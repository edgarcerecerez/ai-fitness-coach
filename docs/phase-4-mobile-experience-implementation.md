# Phase 4: Mobile Experience - Technical Implementation Guide

## Overview

Phase 4 focuses on transforming the AI Calorie Tracker into a native-like mobile experience through Progressive Web App (PWA) features, camera optimization, and quick action workflows. This phase assumes Phases 1-3 are complete (photo upload, AI integration, and core dashboard).

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- **Native-like Experience**: App feels like a native mobile app when installed ✅
- **Offline Capability**: Core functionality works without internet connection ✅
- **Optimized Camera**: Fast, intuitive photo capture with guidance ✅
- **Quick Actions**: Reduce meal logging to <30 seconds ✅
- **Performance**: <3s load time, <1s photo capture ✅

### Success Metrics
- PWA installation rate >30%
- Photo capture completion rate >90%
- Average meal logging time <30 seconds
- Lighthouse PWA score >90

## Technical Architecture

### PWA Architecture
```
Next.js App → Service Worker → IndexedDB (offline) → Supabase (online sync)
```

### Camera Pipeline
```
Camera Stream → Optimized Capture → Image Processing → AI Analysis → Quick Edit
```

### Quick Actions System
```
Gesture/Voice → Action Router → Background Processing → UI Feedback
```

## Implementation Plan

## 1. PWA Implementation

### 1.1 Service Worker Setup

**File**: `public/sw.js`
```javascript
// Core service worker features to implement:
// - Cache API responses
// - Offline fallbacks
// - Background sync
// - Push notifications
```

**File**: `src/lib/pwa/service-worker.ts`
```typescript
// Service worker registration and lifecycle management
```

**Changes Required**:
- [x] Create service worker with caching strategies
- [x] Implement offline fallback pages
- [x] Set up background sync for queued actions
- [x] Configure push notification handlers

### 1.2 App Manifest Configuration

**File**: `public/manifest.json`
```json
{
  "name": "AI Fitness Coach - Calorie Tracker",
  "short_name": "AI Calorie Tracker",
  "description": "Smart calorie tracking with AI photo analysis",
  "start_url": "/", // Changed: Using root URL instead of /app/calorie-tracker
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "categories": ["health", "fitness", "food"],
  "shortcuts": [
    {
      "name": "Quick Photo",
      "short_name": "Photo",
      "description": "Take a quick meal photo",
      "url": "/quick-photo", // Changed: Simplified URL structure
      "icons": [{ "src": "/icons/camera-96x96.png", "sizes": "96x96" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Changes Required**:
- [x] Create app icons (192x192, 512x512, favicon variants) – Added placeholder PNGs under `public/icons/` (filenames: `icon-192x192.png`, `icon-512x512.png`, `icon-72x72.png`, `icon-96x96.png`, `icon-128x128.png`, `icon-144x144.png`, `icon-152x152.png`, `icon-384x384.png`, and favicons `favicon-16x16.png`, `favicon-32x32.png`, `favicon-48x48.png`).
- [x] Configure manifest.json with proper metadata
- [x] Set up shortcuts for quick actions
- [x] Update `next.config.ts` to include manifest

**Implementation Notes:**
- Added more icon sizes (72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 384x384) for better device support
- Added orientation and additional metadata fields
- Included screenshot placeholders for app stores

Icons are located under `public/icons/` and referenced by `public/manifest.json`. Favicon variants are placed under `public/icons/` as `favicon-16x16.png`, `favicon-32x32.png`, `favicon-48x48.png`. Maskable icons (`icon-192x192.png`, `icon-512x512.png`) include `"purpose": "maskable any"` in the manifest to enable proper Android install support.

Placeholder icons were generated with transparent/brand-colored backgrounds to unblock install; swap in final assets later without changing paths.

### 1.3 Offline Data Management

**File**: `src/lib/pwa/offline-storage.ts`
```typescript
interface OfflineEntry {
  id: string;
  type: 'meal_log' | 'photo_upload' | 'user_action';
  data: any;
  timestamp: number;
  synced: boolean;
  retryCount: number; // Added for retry logic
}
```

## 5. Testing Strategy

We added a concise testing plan and initial tests to cover PWA, offline sync, and camera workflows.

### 5.1 Unit Tests
- Service Worker (`public/sw.js`) – using `jest` and `jsdom` with fetch/cache mocks
  - **Caching strategies**: network-first for `/api/*`, cache-first for static assets
  - **Offline fallback**: returns `offline.html` when network fails
  - **Cache timestamping**: `sw-cached-date` header and expiration checks
  - **Update flow**: `install`/`activate` lifecycle behaviors

- Offline Storage & Sync (`src/lib/pwa/offline-storage.ts`, `src/lib/pwa/sync-service.ts`)
  - **IndexedDB/localForage**: read/write, object store creation
  - **Background sync**: queue processing, retry logic, deletion on success
  - **Error handling**: network failures, retries capped, structured results

- Image Optimizer (`src/lib/image/optimizer.ts`)
  - **Permission/capture flows mocked**: optimize, thumbnail, error paths

### 5.2 Integration/E2E Tests
- Camera & Quick Photo (`src/app/quick-photo/page.tsx`, `src/components/calorie-tracker/OptimizedCamera.tsx`)
  - **Permissions**: simulate denied/granted via mocks
  - **Capture/resize**: verify blobs and base64 conversion
  - **Queue/upload**: ensure navigation only after success

We recommend Playwright for E2E (headless mobile emulation) for camera and installation prompts.

### 5.3 Example Test Files
- `src/lib/pwa/__tests__/sw.test.ts` – Service worker fetch strategies and offline fallback (mocks Cache API and `caches.match('/offline.html')`).
- `src/lib/pwa/__tests__/offline-storage.test.ts` – IndexedDB init and read/write operations.
- `src/lib/pwa/__tests__/sync-service.test.ts` – Sync queue processing with `jest.spyOn(global, 'fetch')`.
- `src/components/calorie-tracker/__tests__/OptimizedCamera.test.tsx` – Permission/capture/resize flows with device API mocks.

### 5.4 CI Steps
Update CI (or local scripts) to run tests:
```
npm run lint
npm test -- --runInBand
```
For E2E with Playwright:
```
npx playwright install --with-deps
npx playwright test
```
Ensure service worker and manifest assets are available during E2E by starting the dev server in another process if needed.
